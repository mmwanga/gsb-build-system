Getting Close to 2.20
We're getting very close to finishing GSB 2.20.1 for
Slackware 12.0. Also, we've been in contact with our
former fearless leader, Freerock. In fact, he's been
contributing lots of code!

Your code slaves,

Project Status, Part II
Chip Cuccio sent this to the GSB mailing lists just the other day:
<blockquote class="emph">
<p>Hi folks,</p>

<p>
Myself, and two other regular GSB developers/contributors (Darren and
Jason) are in the process of revitalizing this project. We've tried to
reach our friend Freerock on multiple occasions, with no response from
him (frankly, that worries me/us). We realize that we *absolutely need*
to release a new GNOME distribution for Slack 12.0, and we will.
</p>

<p>
While we're in the process of trying to build a new release for Slack
12.0, I've been tasked with re-inventing our entire web presence and
overall web-based development structure. That means the following facets
will change:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Website (and the overall name of the project)</li>
<li>Which includes new domain name</li>
<li>Mailing lists</li>
<li>Subversion repository</li>
<li>Our IRC channel (now #gsb [on irc.freenode.net])</li>
<li>Other sundry items</li>
</ul>

<p>
We're trying to make this as transparent and smooth as possible.
However, the only thing I /can't/ migrate smoothly, are the mailing
lists. Only Freerock seems to have access to the subscriber list(s),
and I can't migrate them without his response. That said, new lists
will be created, and *you will have to subscribe to those lists
yourselves*. I'll let these current lists know when the new ones are
activated, and inform you how to subscribe. After 2 weeks of the new
lists being turned on, everything in our SF.net project section will
disappear (it's tough to manage it all, so part of the revitalization
effort, includes a consolidation effort as well.).
</p>

<p>
Because no one can reach Freerock, some of the transition won't be as
smooth as we'd like, so we do ask for your patience. :^) The good news
is that the project is still alive, and at least 3 of us are committed
to it. Like any F/OSS project, the more help we can get, the better.
</p>

<p>
I'll communicate to these lists with any and all information with regard
to the project and efforts associated with the new project's changes.
</p>

<p>
We also invite you to the IRC channel for further discussion directly
with the core developers:
</p>

<pre>#gsb on irc.freenode.net</pre>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

Project Status
It's been one year and two days since this news section has been updated.  The volunteer developers are not sure what's been going on with the project's founder and leader, Freerock.  We've tried to touch base with him to see if he'd approve of us simply taking over the project, and to revitalize it.  We're in desperate need of updating FRG/GSB.
<p>If you're a developer, and wish to help revitalize the project, swing on by the <a href="/development/">development section</a>, to learn how to get started.</p>

Thanks.<br />

GNOME 2.14 Available for testing
GNOME 2.14 is available for testing in frg-unstable on the mirrors. I have not
tested any of the packages yet. They have all built cleanly, so they should be fine.
Only the bare minimum desktop is available currently.

<p>The 2.14.1 updates that came out today are currently building along with the bindings.
Extras should be up in a few days.</p>

<p><small>As usual, test and send bug reports.</small></p>

<p>Wow, no News updates since November, I guess we are just imitating Slackware.com very closely.</p>

<p>
  There will be a FRG-0.1.99 release with these fixes as soon as the 
  frg-artwork package is updated.
</p>

###
2005-03-18-1-00-EST
FRG-0.1.97 available
  With the release of frg-0.1.97, we are freezing the applications included
  with FRG. There will be no new software included in the stable release. Hopefully
  this will be the last beta release before the stable 0.2.0 release. We are
  aiming for a Monday, March 21 stable release of FRG with GNOME-2.10.0.

<p>
  To upgrade from the frg-0.1.96 release, download the updates from the frg-0.1.96
  directory. Updates are available here:

<p>
  The only things that need to be finished are the default look and feel. We
  have already set Clearlooks as the default GTK and METACITY theme. We still
  need to set the default ICON and GDM themes. Suggestions on which to use are
  welcome. We are also looking for some artwork to include with the release.
  We are looking for splash screens and some backgrounds that will go well with
  the Clearlooks theme. If you can help out with this check the support page
  for contact infomation.
</p>

<p>
  We would also like to setup a list of users who can be assigned certain
  packages to test out. We have 266 packages in this release and testing all of
  them is difficult to do. If you can help out with this, please see the support
  page for contact details. Please specify the packages that you would like to be
  assigned to test.
</p>

<p>
  There are other things we need help with. See the "Help the Project" and
  Development pages for more info.
</p>

###
2005-03-16-11-00-EST
Final Beta (iso) Release coming soon
  I will release frg-0.1.97 in the next few days. I am hoping that this will
  be the final beta release before calling it a stable release. The updated
  packages will be on rsync and on the following mirror provided graciously by
  Jeremy Brown: ftp://ftp.brownjava.org/pub/frg/

<p>
  If there is any software that you would like to see shipped with FRG
  send an email to the mailing list or to me with the suggestions. See the
  support page for details.
</p>

<p>
  The SVG bug has been found and fixed, thanks to Dagmar from dropline for the
  fix. You just need to run the following command to fix the issue. The librsvg
  package has been fixed to do this for you during installation
</p>

<div>
<pre>$ /usr/bin/gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders > /etc/gtk-2.0/gdk-pixbuf.loaders</pre>

SVG bug somewhere.
  There is a bug with the handling of svg images. Nautilus does not thumbnail
  them and in the Theme Properties, it shows an X image instead of the
  correct SVG image. Anyone have any ideas, email the mailing list or me.

###
2005-03-14-20-15-EST
FRG-0.1.96 Released
  The is the fourth release of FRG with GNOME-2.10.0.

<p>
  If you have either FRG-0.1.94 or FRG-0.1.95, you can download the updated
  packages via rsync instead of downloading the entire iso. Use one of these
  commands depending on what version you are updating from
</p>

<div>
<pre>$ rsync -aPv rsync://freerock.dyndns.org/pub/frg-updates/frg-0.1.94 /tmp
<br />$ rsync -aPv rsync://freerock.dyndns.org/pub/frg-updates/frg-0.1.95 /tmp
<br />$ rsync -aPv rsync://freerock.dyndns.org/pub/frg-updates /tmp</pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Upgrading from frg-0.1.94:</strong> install the updates from the
    frg-0.1.94 rsync directory, then install the updates from the frg-0.1.95
    directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Upgrading from frg-0.1.95:</strong> install the updates from the
    frg-0.1.95 rsync directory.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This release fixes the gdm/logout power off options that were missing from
  GDM's actions menu and from the logout dialogue. It also updates evince which
  would crash trying to thumbnail pdfs. We have also removed gnumeric-1.5.0
  from the office directory and moved it to the testing directory because
  it is an unstable release of gnumeric. It has been replaced with
  gnumeric-1.4.3. That said gnumeric-1.5.0 has been working fine for me.
</p>

<p>
  Also Clearlooks is now the default theme gtk and metacity theme for FRG. We
  have not decided on a default GDM or Icon theme yet. If anyone has any
  suggestions as to what GDM and Icon themes would go good with the Clearlooks
  theme, feel free to suggest them.
</p>

<p>
  Several packages were also updated. The following packages have had version
  updates: bakery, glom, gst-ffmpeg, gtkmm, libsoup, libxml2, libxslt. Also
  bluefish, streamripper, and streamtuner have been added to the other
  directory.
</p>

###
2005-03-14-10-30-EST
FRG-0.1.95 Released
  This is the third release of FRG with GNOME-2.10.0. It fixes the issues
  that were found in the next news item. This is still a beta release, so
  that any bugs can be found and fixed  before calling it a stable release.

<p>
  There are two bugs that still exist. In the gdm Actions menu, the Power Off
  option is not there. The reboot and configure options are still there.
  In the Logout dialogue the Power Off option is also not available. These 2
  things were working properly with the GNOME 2.9.91 FRG packages. This issue
  is most likely related to the gdm and gnome-session packages. We are trying
  to figure out the problems, any help with these issues would be greatly
  appreciated.
</p>

<p>
  As a result of this we have downgraded the gdm package from gdm-2.6.0.8 to
  gdm-2.6.0.7. This fixes the issue with the Power Off option in gdm's Actions
  menu. If you would like to try and fix the gdm issue, the gdm-2.6.0.8
  package is in the testing directory in the iso.
</p>

<p>
  If you were using frg-0.1.94 and want to upgrade to frg-0.1.95, then all you
  need to do is run the following rsync command and upgradepkg the packages in
  the downloaded directory:
</p>

<div>
<pre>$ rsync -aPv rsync://freerock.dyndns.org/pub/frg-updates/frg-0.1.94 /tmp</pre>
</div>

###
2005-03-12-17-00-EST
Updates on FRG-0.1.94 release
<strong>UPDATE MARCH 13:</strong> Some more bugs have been found, some have been
fixed:

<ul>
  <li>
    if you are using min_install.sh to install FRG, install the 
    desktop-file-utils-0.10-i486-1frg.tgz package in the other/ directory in
    the iso. It is needed for correct mime-type operation. After you install
    this package, as root, run.
  </li>
</ul>

<div>
  <pre>$ /usr/bin/update-desktop-database</pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    GDM and the logout dialogue in the Desktop menu do not show the power off
    option. They do show the reboot option though. This was working properly 
    with GNOME-2.9.91 release. I'm currently looking as to what changed in 
    the gdm and gnome-session packages to try and fix it.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>END UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>
  Thank you to everyone who provided feedback on the release. We have found
  and fixed a few bugs.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>xkbd issues. new libxklavier and control-center packages fix this</li>
  <li>New gstreamer and gst-plugins packages
  <ul>
    <li>
      gst-register does not get run when gstreamer and gst-plugins
      packages are installed
    </li>
    <li>
      libgstxine.so causes gst-register to seg fault. I 
      thought I had fixed the slackbuild to fix
      this as this issue popped up earlier. Its now fixed in SVN.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The gdm actions menu does not show the power off option anymore in version
    2.6.0.8. The reboot and configure options are still there. Anyone know
    what gives? gdm-2.6.0.7 package works fine, its available on the rsync
    server below.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To download the updated packages, run the following rsync command:</p>

<div>
<pre>$ rsync -aPv rsync://freerock.dyndns.org/pub/frg-updates/frg-0.1.94 /tmp</pre>
</div>

<p>
  That command will download the frg-updates directory to /tmp. Then just run upgradepkg
  on those packages.
</p>

<p>
  libnss.so is needed for the release. So for Slackware-10.1 users,  
  mozilla-1.7.5-i486-1 must be installed. If you are using 
  slackware-current you can do one of the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>install the slackware-10.1 mozilla package</li>
  <li>add /usr/lib/firefox to /etc/ld.so.conf</li>
  <li>
    symlink the libraries from /usr/lib/firefox into /usr/lib. The
    following should do that for you. It was taken from the mozilla.SlackBuild
    in the Slackware 10.1 source tree.
  </li>
</ul>

<div>
<pre>$ cd /usr/lib/firefox 
$ for nsslib in libnspr4.so libnss3.so libplc4.so libplds4.so \
    libsmime3.so libsoftokn3.so libssl3.so ; do \
    ln -sf $nsslib ../$nsslib done</pre>
</div>

GNOME 2.10.0 packages for Slackware 10.1
FRG-0.1.93 has been released for testing. It contains packages of GNOME 2.10.0
built on slackware 10.1. Test and send feedback to the mailing list. Check the
Support page for details.
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> FRG-0.1.94 has been released with updated packages.
Sabayon now works when started from a user account, you'll still need the root
password though</p>

2005-02-26-12-45-EST
GSB Build Order Slightly Wrong
While looking at the configure.in files to try and populate the slack-required files for slapt-get,
I noticed that the build order for GSB is wrong for some packages. I am currently fixing 
this in SVN. I am following the order more or less given by <strong>jhbuild list</strong> instead
of the documentation on gnome.org. This will not affect the build if you have previous versions
of some libs installed. Mainly glib2, gtk2, and libxml2.
<p>The order was wrong mainly for gstreamer, libcroco, and libgst. For the rest of the build, the order
was more or less right</p>
 
###
2005-02-22-00-30-EST
KDE Menus might get changed
The KDE menus might be changed if you install FRG because of the gnome-menus
package, The gnome-menus package implements the freedesktop.org desktop menu spec.
There is a simple fix for this. Just add the following near the top of the
startkde script:
<div>
<pre>$ export XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/opt/kde/etc/xdg</pre>
</div>
<p>If the improper menus persist, run kbuildsycoca from Konsole after you have
logged into KDE. Thanks to Jim Philips and Locustfurnace for pointing 
it out.</p>

###
2005-02-19-12-00-EST
Freerock GNOME version 0.0.2.2 Released
It is available for download as an iso on the <a href="/downloads">download</a> page.
<br />
This release is a bug fix release:
<ul>
  <li>Abiword and Gstreamer crashes were fixed, some bad plugins were at fault</li>
  <li>Howl is actually installed by the install script</li>
  <li>rc.hal fixed, there was a missing quotation mark on one of the lines.
    If you already have hal installed, please edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.howl script,
    and edit the line with echo "Starting Howl and add a " to the end</li>
  <li>added openldap and cyrus-sasl packages needed by evolution</li>
</ul>
<p>The next release will feature a sources iso, so that it will be easier for
users to take the iso and build a gnome release on their own. A user would
need to download the iso, mount it, then run GSB.SlackBuild and out will come
their slackware packages.</p>

###
2005-02-18-14-20-EST
Fix for abiword package
