# THIS IS THE REPLACED PACKAGES LIST FOR GSB GNOME @GNOME_VERSION@
#
# The following is a list of packages that can replace official Slackware
# @SLACKWARE_VERSION@ packages.
#
# Packages listed under 'Required' are Slackware packages that MUST be replaced
# by corresponding GNOME SlackBuild versions in order to use GNOME
# @GNOME_VERSION@ on Slackware @SLACKWARE_VERSION@. Reasons for their
# replacement are given within brackets.
#
# Packages listed under 'Optional' are packages which replace official
# Slackware packages, but their replacement are only necessary for added
# functionality, or certain GNOME applications.  Their replacement is
# recommended, but not required if you do not plan to use certain applications,
# or are dead set against replacing any Slackware provided packages.
