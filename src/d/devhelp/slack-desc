# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

devhelp: Devhelp's primary goal is to be an API documentation browser for
devhelp: GNOME. When you build (or install) a GNOME library, it will build 
devhelp: an API reference for you and install it into /usr/share/gtk-doc/html.
devhelp: Along with the HTML files, a .devhelp and/or .devhelp2 index file is
devhelp: also generated automatically. Thus Devhelp can simply scan that
devhelp: folder for those index files and display the books they represent.
